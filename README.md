## Development Process:

--Planning & Design:

1. The development process began with designing the app interface inspired by AJIO’s sleek and modern UI.
2. Chose React.js for the frontend due to its component-based structure and ease of development.
3. Decided on Tailwind CSS and Material UI for responsive and customizable UI components.
4. Set up state management using Redux Toolkit to handle data across different components, especially for managing user authentication and cart operations.

##

--Setting up Authentication:

1. Integrated Firebase and JWT for authentication based on API documentation.
2. Implemented login, signup, and authentication redirect to ensure users are directed to the login page when they attempt to add items to the cart without being logged in.

##

## Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented:

1. --Challenge: User Authentication Persistence Across Tabs:
   _Problem_: User authentication was not persistent across different tabs, causing users to log in again when switching tabs during a session.
   _Solution_: Firebase already creates a session for user after login or signup so we used it and used onAuthStateChanged function of firebase that acts as an observer to check if the user is authenticated and then everytime we load page then it observes for the authentication and then we used redux toolkit to store user everytime we got the user.

2. --Challenge: Maintaining a Responsive and Consistent UI:
   _Problem_: Ensuring the UI was responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
   _Solution_: Used Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-based styling, ensuring the design adapted well to various screen sizes.
